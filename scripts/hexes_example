# Layout
#
# You can nest boxes indefinitely, though some layouts may fail on some screen
# sizes. You can specify text for boxes, whether that text should be flowed or
# treated as fixed, whether child boxes should be laid out horizontally or
# vertically, height and width for boxes, etc.

# Logic
#
# Instantiate the application with the layout attached.
# Register any pre-defined behaviors you want (right now, that's only `quit`)
# using the same mechanism as custom behaviors, `app.on`.
app = Application(root=root)
app.on('q', quit)


# Define custom behavior with the `@app.on` decorator. This decorator
# requires an event identifier, which is either 'ready' or a key identifier
# as returned by `curses.window.getkey`
@app.on('ready')
def show_files(app):
    # For this example, we're just gonna output an `ls` of the local directory.
    ls = str(subprocess.check_output('ls'), 'utf-8')
    if ls_box.text != ls:
        ls_box.text = ls
    # To run a task forever, you have to tell it to schedule itself again:
    app.schedule(show_files)


@app.on('j')
def scroll_down(app):
    ls_box.scroll(1)


@app.on('k')
def scroll_up(app):
    ls_box.scroll(-1)

# Run
#
# The context manager helps us clean up no matter what exceptional exit
# conditions we have.
